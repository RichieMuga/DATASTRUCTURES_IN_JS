// This is a fifo datastructure, in that it is a first in first ou datastructure
// imagine a queue for a bank, the first person to get there, gets to be served as the first one

// These are the big(O) of the following operations in queue datastructure
// lookup O(n), we usually dont do this on the datastructure
// dequeue O(1), this is simply removing the first item on the list
// enqueue O(1), this is the adding of an item to the end of the list
// peek O(1), this is first item that is going to come out

//Don't use arrays to create a queue.

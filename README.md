# DATASTRUCTURES_IN_JS
## We will start off with DataScructures then move on to Algorithims.

## DataStructures
You need to knoww how to write the data structures from scratch then implementation of the datastructure then move on to leetcode. The following is the order in which we will look at the Datastructures:
### Linked Lists(Look on branch history to see progress from step 1)
Under Linked List is the following:
    Singly Linked Lists
    Doubly Linked Lists
#### Singly LinkedList
We have to know the big(o) of each method/ action taken in a linked list, to do this we have to implement the classes of the following methods perfomed in the datastructure:
They include the following:
- append(This is adding to the end of the list)(o(1))
- prepend(This is adding to the beggining of the list)(o(1))
- lookup(This is transversing the list)(o(n))
- insert(This is adding to any index of the list)(o(n))
- remove(This is deleting any index of the list)(o(n))
NB: THE BIG(O) is after the description of each methods
NB: The code is available on the repo above with its respective name
